# Tetris
Personal Tetris project with standard game features as well as restart, quit and global scoreboard updating. The scoreboard has built-in profanity checking to prevent malicious name submissions. The game can be played with a transparent background, although playing with a transparent background prevents keyboard input after attempting to submit a scoreboard name.

### Controls

- ESC: Quit the application
- W: Hard drop
- S: Soft drop
- A: Shift left
- D: Shift right
- Q: Rotate left
- E: Rotate right
